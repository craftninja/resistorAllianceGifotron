### Setup:

1. copy `tumblr_keys_example.py` to `tumblr_keys.py`
1. log into a tumbler account and get the required keys listed in the example file
1. install necessary python libs :grimacing:
1. connect hardware as follows:
  * button switch - one lead to ground, one lead to GPIO 18
  * button led - ground lead to ground, positive lead to resistor to GPIO 17
  * lightRing (to be constructed, right now one led) - cathode to ground, anode to resistor to GPIO 27

### How did this get made?

1. Followed instructions in instructables to setup pi and create a Tumbler API client with some edits
